## How unit testing is done?
 - Software testing methods like unit testing are essential for assuring the dependability and quality of a program. Early bug detection and correction can save time and money in the long run because it is a cost-effective method.
- The ability to independently test particular pieces of code rather than having to test the complete application is one of the main advantages of unit testing. 
- This improves in spotting issues early on in the development process, before they escalate in complexity and cost to resolve. Unit tests also offer a safety net for upcoming code revisions, making it simpler to make sure that changes to one section of the code do not unintentionally break another.
- Additionally, unit testing encourages a more flexible and reusable code architecture. Developers are compelled to consider the different parts of their code in isolation and how they interact with one another when they design unit tests. As a result, the codebase is better planned and easier to maintain.
